                        led by Dek Woolfson, has just been published in Nature
                        Communications. It has been a long and winding road to
                        get to this point. The project, known as BADASS (Barrel
                        Array Diagnostics And SenSing) to those in the know,
                        started in 2016 with a conversation between Dek and
                        Dave Tew (GSK), while I was a PDRA in Dek's lab. They
                        had come up with this idea to use our peptides to make
                        a sensing array that mimics mammalian olfaction. Dek
                        told me about this and I got very excited, partly
                        because it was just a cool idea, but also because I
                        suggested that we use machine learning (ML) to identify
                        analytes and the robotics platforms to setup the
                        assays.

                        that's not usually how science goes! I was particularly
                        concerned as I knew that there was a risk I was
                        overfitting the data. We continued to work on it and
                        overtime we became more confident that it was working
                        as intended. Eventually, Dek was so convinced that he
